			<p>Step 1 Heat the oil in a medium pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion
			and garlic for 8-10 mins until soft. Add the chorizo and fry for 5
			mins more. Tip in the tomatoes and sugar, and season. Bring to a
			simmer, then add the gnocchi and cook for 8 mins, stirring often,
			until soft. Heat the grill to high.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>Step 2 Stir ¾ of the mozzarella and most of the basil through the
			gnocchi. Divide the mixture between six ovenproof ramekins, or
			put in one baking dish. Top with the remaining mozzarella, then
			grill for 3 mins, or until the cheese is melted and golden. Season,
			scatter over the remaining basil and serve with green salad.</span></p></div>

			<p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here’s the run-down:<br>
			Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
			<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We’re using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan — like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!<br>
			From there, it’s just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients. <br> <br>
			To freeze an unbaked lasagna: Line the pan with foil before assembling, then assemble the lasagna as directly. Let cool completely, and then freeze until solid. Once frozen, lift the frozen lasagna block from the casserole dish, wrap it in more foil, then freeze for up to a month.<br><br>
			To reheat an unbaked frozen lasagna: Remove the lasagna from the freezer and unwrap all the layers of foil. Transfer to the original casserole dish, cover, and let it thaw in the fridge overnight. Once thawed, bake as directed.

			<p>Dishes don’t get much more typically French than boeuf bourguignon. The dish hails from the same region as coq au vin – that’s Burgundy in eastern France – and there are similarities between the two dishes. Boeuf bourguignon is essentially a stew made from beef braised in red wine, beef broth, and seasoned vegetables including pearl onions and mushrooms. Originally a peasant dish, this recipe is now a staple in French restaurants around the world. Traditionally, the cheap cuts of meat would be tenderized in wine for two days to intensify the flavors, although some shortcuts can be taken.
